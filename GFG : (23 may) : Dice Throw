Given n dice each with m faces. Find the number of ways to get sum x which is the summation of values on each face when all the dice are thrown.

Example:

Input: m = 6, n = 3, x = 12
Output: 25
Explanation: There are 25 total ways to get the Sum 12 using 3 dices with faces from 1 to 6.
Input: m = 2, n = 3, x = 6
Output: 1
Explanation: There is only 1 way to get the Sum 6 using 3 dices with faces from 1 to 2. All the dices will have to land on 2.
Constraints:
1 <= m,n,x <= 50

class Solution {
    static int noOfWays(int m, int n, int x) {
        // code here
        int[] prev = new int[x + 1];
        int[] curr = new int[x + 1];

        prev[0] = 1; // Base case: 1 way to reach sum 0 with 0 dice

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            // Reset current array for this round
            for (int j = 0; j <= x; j++) {
                curr[j] = 0;
            }

            for (int j = 1; j <= x; j++) {
                for (int k = 1; k <= m; k++) {
                    if (j - k >= 0) {
                        curr[j] += prev[j - k];
                    }
                }
            }

            // Copy current to previous for next round
            int[] temp = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = temp;
        }

        return prev[x];
        
    }
};
